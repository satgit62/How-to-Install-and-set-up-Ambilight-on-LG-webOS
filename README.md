# How-to-Install-and-set-up-Ambilight-on-LG-webOS

Installation instructions and settings for PicCap (hyperion-webos) and HyperHDR/Hyperion

Attention! PicCap is not able to record DRM-protected video content from TVs' own apps. However, the DRM restrictions do not affect the TV's HDMI inputs, so NETFLIX & Co. can be processed and enjoyed with Ambilight.
